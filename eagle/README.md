# Designing PCBs with Eagle

![eagle schematic](materials/eagle_board.png)

One day introduction into the PCB [(Printed Circuit Board)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) CAD software **Eagle**  ([www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview](hthttps://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)). The workshop offers a fundamental introduction into concepts, user interface and workflow. A full workflow cycle - form schematic to board layout and the final production in a factory in china - will be explained.


- **Date:** Monday **2020-12-21** / **10:00** - **18:00**
- **Registration:** Send me an email or direct message for a **binding** registration. Please make sure that you are able to join the workshop for the **full day**. (The workshop is limited to **15 participants**)
- The workshop will be held **online via MS Teams.**

## Pre/Requirements:

1. Participants should have **good/solid** knowledge in electronics and fundamental electric laws incl. reading schematics, soldering and some experiance with sourcing parts. (At leased you should have already made **some** circuits on breadboards or with perfboard ).
2. It could be helpful to have already a **little** project in mind.
3. Please install the free/educational version of  **EAGLE** form from the [autodesk website](https://www.autodesk.de/products/eagle/free-download?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1). (It's now strangly bundeled with Fursion 360. Look for educational licence )
5. A **three button** mouse incl. **wheel** is **very** helpful!
4. Coffee and food by hand.
